=== What is searX

SearX is a metasearch engine, inspired by the seeks project. It provides
basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms
without storing search data. Queries are made using a POST request on
every browser (except Chrome__). Therefore they show up in neither our
logs, nor your url history. In case of Chrome__ users there is an
exception, SearX uses the search bar to perform GET requests. Searx can
be added to your browser‚Äôs search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.
